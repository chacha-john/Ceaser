# Description
<p>This project implements a Caesar cipher, both encoding, and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25.
  This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). 
  The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC". </p>
